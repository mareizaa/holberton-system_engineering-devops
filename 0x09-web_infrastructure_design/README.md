# 0x09. Web infrastructure design 

### Concepts:

***
__DNS__
> Domain Name Server:
	>> Is a set of protocols and services that allows users to use names instead of having to remember numeric IP addresses..

***
**Monitoring**
	>Project Monitoring is a tool that allows you to control the evolution of a construction project and compare it with the original design. Through this process, it will be possible to check if the project is developing as planned or if there are deviations.

***
**Web Server**
	> A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made through the World Wide Web.

**Network basics**
	> The foundations of networking: switches, routers, and wireless access points. Switches, routers, and wireless access points are the essential networking basics. Through them, devices connected to your network can communicate with one another and with other networks, like the Internet.

**Load balancer**
	> load balancing is a concept used in computing that refers to the technique used to share the work to be performed among several processes, computers, disks or other resources.

**Server**
	> load balancing is a concept used in computing that refers to the technique used to share the work to be performed among several processes, computers, disks or other resources.

**DataBase**
	> It is a warehouse or vault where the system stores the information selected by the user. This information can be stored using defined structures, so that accessing the information is a 	quick process within the database.

**Difference between a web server and an app server:**
	> While a Web server mainly deals with sending HTML for display in a Web browser, an application server provides access to business logic for use by client application programs. The application program can use this logic just as it would call a method on an object (or a function in the procedural world).

**DNS record types**
	>  DNS records (also known as zone files) are instructions that reside on authoritative DNS servers and provide information about a domain, including the IP address that is associated with that domain and how to handle requests for that domain. These records consist of a series of text files written in what is known as DNS syntax. DNS syntax is just a string of characters that are used as commands that tell the DNS server what to do. All DNS records also have a 'TTL', which stands for time-to-live, and indicates how often a DNS server will update that record.
 
**Spof**
	> A single point of failure or single point of failure1 (SPOF) is a component of a system that after a failure in its operation causes a global failure in the entire system, rendering it inoperative. A SPOF can be a hardware, software or electrical component.

	> To guarantee the non-existence of a SPOF in a system, all its components are usually redundant, thus forming a high availability system, which guarantees correct operation even in the event of failure of any of its components.

**What is HTTPS**
	> The Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol based on the HTTP protocol, intended for the secure transfer of hypertext data, i.e. it is the secure version of HTTP.

**What is a firewall**
	> In computing, a firewall is the part of a computer system or a computer network that is designed to block unauthorized access while allowing authorized communications.firewalls. can be implemented in hardware or software, or a combination of both.
